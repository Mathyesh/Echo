# Echo

Voice-Controlled AI Assistant with OpenAI GPT-3 and Speech Recognition

Overview:
This project demonstrates the creation of a voice-controlled AI assistant using Python, the OpenAI GPT-3 model, and the SpeechRecognition library. The AI assistant, named "Echo," listens to voice commands, processes them using speech recognition, and responds with text-to-speech capabilities.


Features:
Voice-controlled interaction with an AI assistant.
Real-time conversation with the AI.
Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating responses.
Voice input and output using Python libraries.


Prerequisites:
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:-
Python 3.x
OpenAI API key (obtain one from OpenAI)
SpeechRecognition library (pip install SpeechRecognition)
Pyttsx3 library (pip install pyttsx3)


Setup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:-
bash:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git

2. Create a .env file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:-
env:
OPENAI_KEY=your_api_key_here

3. Install the required Python libraries:-
