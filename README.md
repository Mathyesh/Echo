Voice-Controlled AI Assistant with OpenAI GPT-3 and Speech Recognition

Overview:

This project demonstrates the creation of a voice-controlled AI assistant using Python, the OpenAI GPT-3 model, and the SpeechRecognition library. The AI assistant, named "Echo", listens to voice commands, processes them using speech recognition, and responds with text-to-speech capabilities.


Features:

1. Voice-controlled interaction with an AI assistant.
2. Real-time conversation with the AI.
3. Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating responses.
4. Voice input and output using Python libraries.


Prerequisites:

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:-

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenAI API key (obtain one from OpenAI)
3. SpeechRecognition library (pip install SpeechRecognition)
4. Pyttsx3 library (pip install pyttsx3)


Setup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:-

bash:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git

2. Create a .env file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:-

env:
OPENAI_KEY=your_api_key_here

3. Install the required Python libraries:-

bash:
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 


You can customize the assistant's name, initial greeting, and other parameters in the code.


NOTE:

The API key used in the demonstration video is no longer active and will not have access to the OpenAI GPT-3 model. To use this project with your own OpenAI API key, please follow the setup instructions in the README and replace the placeholder `your_api_key_here` with your valid API key.
